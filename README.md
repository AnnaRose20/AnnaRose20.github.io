## About Me

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science actively seeking an internship opportunity in Agentic AI and intelligent automation. I bring hands-on experience working in agile development environments through my industrial internship, where I collaborated with cross-functional teams using tools such as Jira and Confluence to support iterative development and product delivery.

I have a strong foundation in data-driven problem solving, along with proficiency in MS Office tools for documentation, analysis, and professional presentations. I enjoy working collaboratively, contributing ideas, and supporting team goals to deliver high-quality results efficiently.

Motivated, adaptable, and eager to learn, I thrive in collaborative environments and aim to contribute meaningfully while continuously developing my technical and professional skills in real-world AI systems.
